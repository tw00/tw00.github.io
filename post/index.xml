It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that this couldn&amp;rsquo;t be done with any other framework.
Today most CI systems for React applications looks something like this: Push code, merge code, install dependencies, run tests, create container, install dependencies again, deploy container to fresh nodes, tear down old nodes. etc.
But what if we could skip all these steps? What if we could just deploy a React component directly?</description></item><item><title>COVID-19 Simulator</title><link>https://tw00.dev/post/covid/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 10:38:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://tw00.dev/post/covid/</guid><description> let root = document.getElementById('exp-09').shadowRoot; let container = root.querySelector('.covid-sim'); container.style.margin = "0";</description></item><item><title>Announcing heliosRX</title><link>https://tw00.dev/post/heliosrx/annoucement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:11:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://tw00.dev/post/heliosrx/annoucement/</guid><description>The future of the web is real-time. With Firebase Realtime Database Google offers a great product to write real-time web applications without the hassle of setting up an infrastructure yourself. Simply create a project and within minutes you will have your backend up and running and can start developing.
While getting started with Firebase is easy, you&amp;rsquo;ll soon run into some problems as your application is becoming increasingly more complex:</description></item><item><title>Solving Optimization Problems with Chemotaxis</title><link>https://tw00.dev/post/other/chemoxtaxis/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 00:19:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://tw00.dev/post/other/chemoxtaxis/</guid><description>When I started my career as a control engineer, a very wise man once told me a little trick, how to solve almost any real-life optimization problem with an algorithm that is so simple that it just takes 6 lines of code and you can remember it for the rest of your life once you understand how it works.
I&amp;rsquo;ve since passed on this wisdom to almost all students I supervised and I find it so valuable that I will share it here.</description></item><item><title>JS: The world's smallest logging library</title><link>https://tw00.dev/post/js-tips/js-tips-01-console-log/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2019 00:19:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://tw00.dev/post/js-tips/js-tips-01-console-log/</guid><description>Real pro&amp;rsquo;s debug with console.log ;-) So let&amp;rsquo;s build a the world&amp;rsquo;s smallest logging library. It is called picolog or plog for short as has ZERO dependencies.
